      <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
      <p>
For all the times that you rained on my parade<br>
And all the clubs you get in using my name<br>
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake<br>
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't</p>

    <section>
      <h3>[Refrain]</h3>
      <p>
And I didn't wanna write a song<br>
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care<br>
I don't, but you still hit my phone up<br>
And baby, I'll be movin' on<br>
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back<br>
Maybe you should know that</p>

      <h3>[Pre-Chorus]
</h3>
      <p>
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br>
And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br>
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on<br>
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

      <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
      <p>
'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
Oh baby, you should go and <span><em> Love</em></span> yourself<br>
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>
You should go and  <span><em> Love</em></span>  yourself</p>

      <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
      <p>
But when you told me that you hated my friends<br>
The only problem was with you and not them<br>
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong<br>
And tried to make me forget where I came from

      <h3>[Bridge]</h3>
<p>For all the times that you made me feel small<br>
I fell in  <span><em> Love</em></span> , now I feel nothin' at all<br>
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable<br>
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
